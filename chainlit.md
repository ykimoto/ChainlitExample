# Welcome to the DataStax PDF Chat Demo ! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

Hi, this is demo to demonstrate the use of Astra DB as a vector store to perform retrieval of context data derived from a PDF file.

It will query the vector store based on the question you ask and provide that as a basis for the LLM to respond with an answer to your question.

Have Fun!! ðŸ‘‹
